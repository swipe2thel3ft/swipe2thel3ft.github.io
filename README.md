## Introduction
Im a driven individual who has worked all sorts of manual labor jobs from the oilfields to warehousing in order to raise money to attempt to go back to school but finding the stars never aligning. After some unforseen circumstances and being unemployed i decided now was the time to pull the trigger and with the help of the WIOA program was able to enroll in the CNM Java +Android deep dive boot camp to go ahead and learn a new skill that will hopefully open the door to a new career.
